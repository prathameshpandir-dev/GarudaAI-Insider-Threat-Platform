- **Columns**:
  - `event_id` (Primary Key): Mail identifier.
  - `employee_id` (Foreign Key -> `employees.employee_id`): Sender identity.
  - `timestamp`: Sent time.
  - `recipient_domain`: Domain of recipient (e.g., `gmail.com`, `competitor-defense.com`).

  - `attachment_size_mb`: Size of files attached.

### 7. `privilege_escalation.csv`
- **Purpose**: Log of administrative privilege changes.

## Join Graph (Key Relationships)

```mermaid
erDiagram
    employees ||--o{ logon_activity : "employee_id"
    employees ||--o{ file_access : "employee_id"
    employees ||--o{ device_usage : "employee_id"
    employees ||--o{ http_activity : "employee_id"
    employees ||--o{ email_activity : "employee_id"
    employees ||--o{ privilege_escalation : "employee_id"
    employees ||--|| ground_truth_labels : "employee_id"
    employees }o--o| employees : "manager_id -> employee_id"
```

- `employees.employee_id` acts as the primary hub.
- All transactional activity datasets connect to `employees.employee_id` via a one-to-many relationship.
- Self-referencing join exists inside `employees` via `manager_id -> employee_id` to establish the reporting hierarchy.

## Mapping Data to Security Features

1. **Behavior Trust Score**:
   - Out-of-hours logins (`logon_activity`), unapproved devices, access to `Confidential` or `Restricted` documents (`file_access`), external email file transfers (`email_activity`), and privilege changes without sound justification (`privilege_escalation`) trigger configured deductions.
2. **Attack Timeline**:
   - Queries all transactional logs (Logon, File, Device, HTTP, Email, Escalation) for a single `employee_id`, ordered chronologically by `timestamp`.
3. **AI Investigation Assistant**:
   - Fed with the reconstructed chronological timeline and employee organizational metadata to generate narratives explaining the context, business risk, and recommended action.
4. **Smart Recommendations**:
   - Derived from specific activity categories (e.g., block USB, suspend account for impossible travel, flag for HR review upon intensive job searching).

## MVP Scoping & Data Quality Caveats

- **Essential Datasets (MVP)**:
  - `employees`: Crucial for identity and routing.
  - `logon_activity`, `file_access`, `device_usage`: Required for the core risk vectors (After-hours logins, unauthorized exfiltration, data harvesting).
  - `ground_truth_labels`: Crucial for validating the scoring engine algorithms.
- **Deferrable Datasets (Phase 2 / Extensions)**:
  - `http_activity` and `email_activity` add flavor but could be simplified or simulated if memory constraints are hit.
- **Data-Quality Caveats**:
  - Synthetic times are internally consistent across logs for designated threat scenarios, but normal activity uses random distributions. This means standard users may have minor anomalous overlaps, which mirrors real-world security noise.
